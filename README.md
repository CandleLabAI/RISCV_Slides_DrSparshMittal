# RISCV_Slides_DrSparshMittal
Dr Sparsh's lecture slides on RISC-V ISA 

I have prepared these slides from following sources. I have personally added several insights, illustrations and solved examples: 
* RISC-V manual
* Prof Smruti Ranjan Sarangi's material (IIT Delhi)
* IIT Madras Shaki project documents
* "The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas" by David Patterson and Andrew Waterman
* Various sources on the internet
