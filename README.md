# RISCV_Slides_DrSparshMittal
Dr Sparsh's lecture slides on RISC-V ISA 

I have prepared these slides from following sources. I have personally added several insights, illustrations and solved examples (especially C to RISC-V conversion).
* RISC-V manual
* Prof Smruti Ranjan Sarangi's material (IIT Delhi)
* IIT Madras Shaki project documents
* "The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas" by David Patterson and Andrew Waterman
* Dan Garcia (UC Berkeley) 
* Various sources on the internet

If you find any issues, or have suggestions, please raise an issue through "Issues" tab on github.
